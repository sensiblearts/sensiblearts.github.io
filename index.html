</li><li>Events &amp; Signups → sales or other meetups
</li><li>Catalogs &amp; Reservations → items or services
</li><li>Sales Register → remote or on-site exchanges
</li><li>Blog posts for thoughts &amp; stories
</li></ul><p>I plan to “dogfood” the system in 2021 by selling some seeds that I’ve been saving over the years, including some hot pepper lines that I’m breeding. I’ll probably <a href="posts">blog abot that later</a></p><p> <br/>   </p><h3 id="2019-→-trees-now-isabella.org">2019 → <a href="http://trees-now-isabella.org">trees-now-isabella.org</a></h3><p><img src="https://treeplace-logos.s3.amazonaws.com/org_1_logo.png?v=63765193385" alt="trees NOW logo" width="30%"/></p><p>Back in (I think it was) August of 2019, I was contacted by Jim Hageman, Graduate Dean, Retired from Central Michigan University. Jim asked if I would help him form a tree planting organization. To make a long story short: I am now a cofounder, and I built a website to facilitate that effort: Trees NOW Isabella. Our goal is reforestation in Isabella County, Michigan.</p><p>The risks and costs of not addressing climate change are becoming impossible to ignore. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions must be cut dramatically and rapidly. Trees also reduce CO<sub>2</sub> by reducing heating and cooling needs. We can all better manage vegetation — including our many small lawns and woodlots — to capture more CO<sub>2</sub>. Planting and maintaining trees is part of this.  Planting trees is not a substitute for keeping fossil fuels in the ground, but nearly everyone can help in some way with tree planting events or decisions. Also, trees provide financial and many other benefits.</p><p>Trees NOW Isabella is operating as a Project Partner of the <a href="https://uwgic.org">United Way of Gratiot &amp; Isabella Counties</a>.</p><p> <br/>   </p><h3 id="2019-→-treeplace.org">2019 → <a href="https://treeplace.org">treeplace.org</a></h3><p><img src="https://treeplace.org/images/logo_tp_1.jpg" alt="treeplace logo" width="15%"/></p><p>When I decided to build a site for Trees NOW Isabella (above), I wanted to make it <em>reusable for non-web developers:</em> Why not make this tech available to any town, particularly other small towns who wish to start a tree planting effort?</p><p>Hence, the idea for treeplace.org.  Anyone can go to treeplace.org and create a web <em>sub</em>-site. For example, the Trees NOW Isabella site is at <a href="https://treeplace.org/trees-now-isabella">treeplace.org/trees-now-isabella</a>. Features include:</p><ul><li>Find organizations by state &amp; county
</li><li>“Follow” an organization for email announcements
</li><li>Add your organization to the listing
</li><li>Tips on starting a new organization
